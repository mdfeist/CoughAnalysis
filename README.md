# Setup

Create folder `data_oct_2022` and add the `cleaned.csv` file to it.

# Run

## Clean Data

You can run `python clean_data.py` but isn't needed if you already have `cleanded.csv`. If you do run this then add `rsm021_combined.csv` to the `data_oct_2022` folder.

## Check Data

`python check_data.py` this just creates some basic graphs.

## Cluster

`python cluster.py` this clusters the cough data by day.


## Results

All the results for each of these algorithms should be in the `results` directory.
